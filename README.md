## 🔐 Security

### Security Measures Implemented

**1. Data Encryption**:
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Encrypted database backups
- Secure document storage

**2. Authentication & Authorization**:
- OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Biometric authentication (mobile)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with auto-logout

**3. API Security**:
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS configuration
- API key rotation
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection

**4. Compliance**:
- GDPR compliance
- PCI DSS compliance (payments)
- KYC/AML procedures
- Data privacy regulations
- Regular security audits

**5. Back Office Security**:
- IP address whitelisting
- DCA email domain restriction
- Mandatory 2FA for all users
- Audit logging (2-year retention)
- Password policies and complexity requirements

### Security Best Practices

```javascript
// Example: Secure API call with JWT
const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.API_URL,
  timeout: 10000,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
});

// Add JWT token to requests
apiClient.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = getSecureToken();
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

// Handle token expiration
apiClient.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  async (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      await refreshToken();
      return apiClient.request(error.config);
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```
